# Group 39 FYDP Design Log/Docs

This repo contains the design log/documentation for FYDP.

## Quickstart

First, you'll need Node.js installed on your computer. v18.18.0 (the LTS version as of Oct 5th 2023) should be fine.

Then, clone the repo. After cloning, run the following commands in the root folder (fydp_design_log):

```
npm install
gatsby develop

```
Running ```gatsby develop``` will let you run the website on localhost, with live reload.

## Managing Content

All content is stored in the `content` folder. Help pages are all written in __Markdown__.

To create a new help page, simply create a new `.md` file in the content folder. To place the document in a specific location in the left sidebar, add the path in `forcedNavOrder` found in `config.js`.

The url is generated using the title of the `.md` file, so name the file accordingly. 

### Adding pictures

Add pictures right in the content folder. To help keep it organized, you should add __n-__ as a prefix, where n is a number. This will keep the structure of the content folder. Screenshots should be relevant to what is being described on the page.

## ðŸ”§ Configure

Write markdown files in `content` folder.

Open `config.js` for templating variables. Broadly configuration is available for `gatsby`, `header`, `sidebar` and `siteMetadata`.

- `gatsby` config for global configuration like 
    - `pathPrefix` - Gatsby Path Prefix
    - `siteUrl` - Gatsby Site URL

- `header` config for site header configuration like
    - `title` - The title that appears on the top left
    - `githubUrl` - The Github URL for the docs website
    - `helpUrl` - Help URL for pointing to resources
    - `tweetText` - Tweet text
    - `links` - Links on the top right
    - `search` - Enable search and [configure Algolia](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-search-with-algolia/)

- `sidebar` config for navigation links configuration
    - `forcedNavOrder` for left sidebar navigation order. It should be in the format "/\<filename>"
    - `frontLine` - whether to show a front line at the beginning of a nested menu.(Collapsing capability would be turned of if this option is set to true)
    - `links` - Links on the bottom left of the sidebar
    - `ignoreIndex` - Set this to true if the index.md file shouldn't appear on the left sidebar navigation. Typically this can be used for landing pages.

- `siteMetadata` config for website related configuration
    - `title` - Title of the website
    - `description` - Description of the website
    - `ogImage` - Social Media share og:image tag
    - `docsLocation` - The Github URL for Edit on Github

- For sub nesting in left sidebar, create a folder with the same name as the top level `.md` filename and the sub navigation is auto-generated. The sub navigation is alphabetically ordered.

### Algolia Configuration

In the future, if we want to setup Algolia, go to `config.js` and update the `search` object to look like the one below:

```...,
	"search": {
		"enabled": true,
		"indexName": "MY_INDEX_NAME",
		"algoliaAppId": process.env.GATSBY_ALGOLIA_APP_ID,
		"algoliaSearchKey": process.env.GATSBY_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY,
		"algoliaAdminKey": process.env.ALGOLIA_ADMIN_KEY
	},
```

Values for Algolia App ID, Search Key, and Admin Key can be obtained from Algolia Dashboard with the right set of permissions. Replace `MY_INDEX_NAME` with the Algolia Index name of your choice. To build the Algolia index, you need to run `npm run build` which will do a gatsby build along with content indexing in Algolia.
